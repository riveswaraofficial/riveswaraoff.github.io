     <p> I am a YPC International College student studying a Bachelor of Multimedia Computing degree. There are many reason I choose to study in Bachelor of Multimedia computing.
      The main reason is I love video games. Video games actually inspired me to create my own games one day in future. Since that day, I planned out my life to be a game designer. 
      I started to learn more about computer and discover new things. Overtime, I learned some advanced features of computer before I started my college life. I felt motivated and thrive be game designer.
